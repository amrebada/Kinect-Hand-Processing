This code trackes the fingertips of the tracked user. Both hands are tracked, and the user is free to move about the scene.
The code using OpenCV to process the hands (specifically thresholding, convex hull, contours, and convexity defects)

To compile this project you will need the following dependencies installed:

OpenNI 1.5+ (this code does autocalibration)
NITE
SensorKinect (if using Kinect)
OpenCV 2+
CMake

Here's a video showing the code running: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeHX5jzHFM4
