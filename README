This code tracks the fingertips of the user. Both hands are tracked, and the user is free to move about the scene.

The program uses OpenCV to process the hands (specifically: thresholding, convex hull, contours, and convexity defects)

To compile this project you will need the following dependencies installed:

OpenNI 1.5+ (this code does autocalibration)
NITE
SensorKinect (if using Kinect)
OpenCV 2+
CMake

Here's a video showing the code running: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeHX5jzHFM4
